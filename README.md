# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

This is a book about data structures and algorithms, the primary goal of this book is practicing my go lang and english writing skills. And of course I hope this could help somebody.

The idea is highly inspired by the following projects:

1. [Book of Elementary Algorithms and Data structures](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY)
2. [Algorithms &amp; Data structures in C++](https://github.com/xtaci/algorithms)
3. [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/prakhar1989/Algorithms)
4. [Algorithms &amp; Data Structures in Go](https://github.com/arnauddri/algorithms)
5. [https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures](https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures)
6. [Algorithms and data structures for golang](https://github.com/0xAX/go-algorithms)
