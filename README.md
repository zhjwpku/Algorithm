# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

This is a book about data structures and algorithms, the primary goal of this book is practicing my go lang and english writing skills. And of course I hope this could help somebody.

The idea is highly inspired by the following projects:

1. [https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY "Book of Elementary Algorithms and Data structures")
2. [https://github.com/xtaci/algorithms](https://github.com/xtaci/algorithms "Algorithms &amp; Data structures in C++")
